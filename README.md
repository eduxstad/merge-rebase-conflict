# merge-rebase conflict. 
Show the conflicts between merges and rebases.

# Instructions
I have a branch 'feature' that has a subbranch 'feature-test' that was merged in, with merge conflicts fixed. Now I want to rebase 'feature' onto the latest commit of 'master' (so that the 'feature' branch includes this text). But if I go into 'feature' and try to rebase, there is a merge conflict! Even if I have already resolved all of the conflicts. But you can do this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30136558/how-to-squash-commits-which-have-merge-commit-in-between.
